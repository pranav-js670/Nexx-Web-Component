## Tech Stack

- **Integration**: Connects to the Nexx SaaS platform via API for feedback management and analytics.

## Linking to Nexx SaaS Platform

The feedback collected via this web component is managed in the [**Nexx SaaS Platform**](https://github.com/pranav-js670/Nexx-SaaS-product.git). Be sure to set up the SaaS platform before integrating this component into your website.
